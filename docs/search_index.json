For example, suppose we are interested in estimating: \\(p\\): the (unknown) proportion of American college students, 18-24, who have a smartphone \\(\\mu\\): the (unknown) mean number of days it takes Alzheimer’s patients to achieve certain milestones In either case, we can’t possibly survey the entire population. That is, we can’t survey all American college students between the ages of 18 and 24. Nor can we survey all patients with Alzheimer’s disease. So, of course, we take a random sample from the population and use the resulting data to estimate the value of the population parameter. However, we want the estimate to be “good” in some way. In this lesson, we’ll learn two methods, namely the method of maximum likelihood and the method of moments, for deriving formulas for “good” point estimates for population parameters. We’ll also learn one way of assessing whether a point estimate is “good.” We’ll do that by defining what it means for an estimate to be unbiased. 1.1.1 Definitions We’ll start the lesson with some formal definitions. In doing so, recall that we denote the \\(n\\) random variables arising from a random sample as subscripted uppercase letters: \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\). The corresponding observed values of a specific random sample are then denoted as subscripted lowercase letters: \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\). Parameter Space The range of possible values of the parameter \\(\\theta\\) is called the parameter space \\(\\Omega\\) (the Greek letter “omega”). For example, if \\(\\mu\\) denotes the mean grade point average of all college students, then the parameter space (assuming a 4-point grading scale) is: \\[ \\Omega = \\{ \\mu : 0 \\leq \\mu \\leq 4 \\} \\] And, if \\(p\\) denotes the proportion of students who smoke cigarettes, then the parameter space is: \\[ \\Omega = \\{ p : 0 \\leq p \\leq 1 \\} \\] Point Estimator The function of \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\), that is, the statistic \\(u = (X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n)\\) used to estimate \\(\\theta\\) is called a point estimator of \\(\\theta\\). For example, the function: \\[ \\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \\] is a point estimator of the population mean \\(\\mu\\). The function: \\[ \\hat{p} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \\] (where \\(X_i = 0\\) or 1) is a point estimator of the population proportion \\(p\\). And, the function: \\[ S^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})^2 \\] is a point estimator of the population variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Point Estimate The function \\(u(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)\\) computed from a set of data is an observed point estimate of \\(\\theta\\). For example, if \\(x_i\\) are the observed grade point averages of a sample of 88 students, then: \\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{88} \\sum_{i=1}^{88} x_i = 3.12 \\] is a point estimate of \\(\\mu\\), the mean grade point average of all the students in the population. And, if \\(x_i = 0\\) if a student has no tattoo, and \\(x_i = 1\\) if a student has a tattoo, then: \\[ \\hat{p} = 0.11 \\] is a point estimate of \\(p\\), the proportion of all students in the population who have a tattoo. Now, with the above definitions aside, let’s go learn about the method of maximum likelihood. 1.2 Maximum Likelihood Estimation Statement of the Problem Suppose we have a random sample \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) whose assumed probability distribution depends on some unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\). Our primary goal here will be to find a point estimator \\(u(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)\\), such that \\(u(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)\\) is a “good” point estimate of \\(\\theta\\), where \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\) are the observed values of the random sample. For example, if we plan to take a random sample \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) for which the \\(X_i\\) are assumed to be normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), then our goal will be to find a good estimate of \\(\\mu\\), say, using the data \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\) that we obtained from our specific random sample. The Basic Idea It seems reasonable that a good estimate of the unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\) would be the value of \\(\\theta\\) that maximizes the probability, or rather, the likelihood, of getting the data we observed. So, that is, in a nutshell, the idea behind the method of maximum likelihood estimation. But how would we implement the method in practice? Well, suppose we have a random sample \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) for which the probability density (or mass) function of each \\(X_i\\) is \\(f(x_i;\\theta)\\). Then, the joint probability mass (or density) function of \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\), which we’ll (not so arbitrarily) call \\(L(\\theta)\\) is: \\[L(\\theta) = P(X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, ..., X_n=x_n) = f(x_1;\\theta) \\cdot f(x_2;\\theta) \\cdot ... \\cdot f(x_n;\\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i;\\theta)\\] In light of the basic idea of maximum likelihood estimation, one reasonable way to proceed is to treat the “likelihood function” \\(L(\\theta)\\) as a function of \\(\\theta\\), and find the value of \\(\\theta\\) that maximizes it. Example 1-1 Suppose we have a random sample \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) where: \\(X_i = 0\\) if a randomly selected student does not own a sports car, and \\(X_i = 1\\) if a randomly selected student does own a sports car. Assuming that the \\(X_i\\) are independent Bernoulli random variables with unknown parameter \\(p\\), find the maximum likelihood estimator of \\(p\\), the proportion of students who own a sports car. Answer If the \\(X_i\\) are independent Bernoulli random variables with unknown parameter \\(p\\), then the probability mass function of each \\(X_i\\) is: \\[f(x_i;\\theta) = p^{x_i} \\cdot (1-p)^{1-x_i}\\] for \\(x_i = 0\\) or 1 and \\(0 &lt; p &lt; 1\\). Therefore, the likelihood function \\(L(p)\\) is, by definition: \\[L(p) = \\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i;\\theta) = p^{x_1} \\cdot (1-p)^{1-x_1} \\cdot p^{x_2} \\cdot (1-p)^{1-x_2} \\cdot ... \\cdot p^{x_n} \\cdot (1-p)^{1-x_n}\\] for \\(0 &lt; p &lt; 1\\). Simplifying, by summing up the exponents, we get: \\[L(p) = p^{\\sum x_i} \\cdot (1-p)^{n - \\sum x_i}\\] Now, in order to implement the method of maximum likelihood, we need to find the \\(p\\) that maximizes the likelihood \\(L(p)\\). We need to put on our calculus hats now since, in order to maximize the function, we are going to need to differentiate the likelihood function with respect to \\(p\\). In doing so, we’ll use a “trick” that often makes the differentiation a bit easier. Note that the natural logarithm is an increasing function of \\(x\\): Alt Text That is, if \\(x_1 &lt; x_2\\), then \\(f(x_1) &lt; f(x_2)\\). That means that the value of \\(p\\) that maximizes the natural logarithm of the likelihood function \\(\\ln L(p)\\) is also the value of \\(p\\) that maximizes the likelihood function \\(L(p)\\). So, the “trick” is to take the derivative of \\(\\ln L(p)\\) (with respect to \\(p\\)) rather than taking the derivative of \\(L(p)\\). Again, doing so often makes the differentiation much easier. (By the way, throughout the remainder of this course, I will use either \\(\\ln L(p)\\) or \\(\\log L(p)\\) to denote the natural logarithm of the likelihood function.) In this case, the natural logarithm of the likelihood function is: \\[ \\log L(p) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\right) \\log(p) + \\left( n - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\right) \\log(1-p) \\] Now, taking the derivative of the log-likelihood, and setting it to \\(0\\), we get: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\log L(p)}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{p} - \\frac{n - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{1-p} \\] Now, multiplying through by \\(p(1-p)\\), we get: \\[ \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\right) (1-p) - (n - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i) p = 0 \\] Upon distribution, we see that two of the resulting terms cancel each other out: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i - p \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i - np + p \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 0 \\] leaving us with: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i - np = 0 \\] Now, all we have to do is solve for \\(p\\). In doing so, you’ll want to make sure that you always put a hat (“^”) on the parameter, in this case, \\(p\\), to indicate it is an estimate: \\[ \\hat{p} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} \\] or, alternatively, an estimator: \\[ \\hat{p} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i}{n} \\] Oh, and we should technically verify that we indeed did obtain a maximum. We can do that by verifying that the second derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to \\(p\\) is negative. It is, but you might want to do the work to convince yourself! Now, with that example behind us, let us take a look at formal definitions of the terms: Likelihood Function Maximum Likelihood Estimators Maximum Likelihood Estimates Definition: Let \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) be a random sample from a distribution that depends on one or more unknown parameters \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, ..., \\theta_m\\) with probability density (or mass) function \\(f(x_i; \\theta_1, \\theta_2, ..., \\theta_m)\\). Suppose that \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, ..., \\theta_m\\) is restricted to a given parameter space \\(\\Omega\\). Then: When regarded as a function of \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, ..., \\theta_m\\), the joint probability density (or mass) function of \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\): \\[ L(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, ..., \\theta_m) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i; \\theta_1, \\theta_2, ..., \\theta_m) \\] \\((\\theta_1, \\theta_2, ..., \\theta_m)\\) in \\(\\Omega\\) is called the likelihood function. If \\([u_1(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n), u_2(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n), ..., u_m(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)]\\) is the m-tuple that maximizes the likelihood function, then: \\[ \\hat{\\theta}_i = u_i(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) \\] is the maximum likelihood estimator of \\(\\theta_i\\), for \\(i = 1,2,...,m\\). The corresponding observed values of the statistics in (2), namely: \\[ [u_1(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n), u_2(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n), ..., u_m(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)] \\] are called the maximum likelihood estimates of \\(\\theta_i\\), for \\(i = 1,2,...,m\\). Example 1-2: Suppose the weights of randomly selected American female college students are normally distributed with unknown mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). A random sample of 10 American female college students yielded the following weights (in pounds): 115, 122, 130, 127, 149, 160, 152, 138, 149, 180. Based on the definitions given above, identify the likelihood function and the maximum likelihood estimator of \\(\\mu\\), the mean weight of all American female college students. Using the given sample, find a maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\mu\\) as well. Answer: The probability density function of \\(X_i\\) is: \\[ f(x_i; \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(x_i - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right] \\] for \\(-\\infty &lt; x &lt; \\infty\\). The parameter space is \\(\\Omega = \\{ (\\mu, \\sigma) : -\\infty &lt; \\mu &lt; \\infty \\text{ and } 0 &lt; \\sigma &lt; \\infty \\}\\). Therefore, the likelihood function is: \\[ L(\\mu, \\sigma) = \\sigma^{-n} (2\\pi)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\mu)^2\\right] \\] for \\(-\\infty &lt; \\mu &lt; \\infty\\) and \\(0 &lt; \\sigma &lt; \\infty\\). It can be shown, upon maximizing the likelihood function with respect to \\(\\mu\\), that the maximum likelihood estimator of \\(\\mu\\) is: \\[ \\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i = \\bar{X} \\] Based on the given sample, a maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\mu\\) is: \\[ \\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \\frac{1}{10} (115 + \\ldots + 180) = 142.2 \\] pounds. Note that the only difference between the formulas for the maximum likelihood estimator and the maximum likelihood estimate is that: the estimator is defined using capital letters (to denote that its value is random), and the estimate is defined using lowercase letters (to denote that its value is fixed and based on an obtained sample). Okay, so now we have the formal definitions out of the way. The first example on this page involved a joint probability mass function that depends on only one parameter, namely P, the proportion of successes. Now, let’s take a look at an example that involves a joint probability density function that depends on two parameters. Example 1-3: Let \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) be a random sample from a normal distribution with unknown mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Find maximum likelihood estimators of mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Answer: In finding the estimators, the first thing we’ll do is write the probability density function as a function of \\(\\theta_1 = \\mu\\) and \\(\\theta_2 = \\sigma^2\\): \\[ f(x_i; \\theta_1, \\theta_2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\theta_2} \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(x_i - \\theta_1)^2}{2\\theta_2}\\right] \\] for \\(-\\infty &lt; \\theta_1 &lt; \\infty\\) and \\(0 &lt; \\theta_2 &lt; \\infty\\). We do this so as not to cause confusion when taking the derivative of the likelihood with respect to \\(\\sigma^2\\). Now, that makes the likelihood function: \\[ L(\\theta_1, \\theta_2) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i; \\theta_1, \\theta_2) = \\theta_2^{-\\frac{n}{2}} (2\\pi)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2\\theta_2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\theta_1)^2 \\right] \\] and therefore the log of the likelihood function: \\[ \\log L(\\theta_1, \\theta_2) = -\\frac{n}{2} \\log \\theta_2 - \\frac{n}{2} \\log(2\\pi) - \\frac{\\sum{(x_i - \\theta_1)^2}}{2\\theta_2} \\] Now, upon taking the partial derivative of the log likelihood with respect to \\(\\theta_1\\), and setting to 0, we see that a few things cancel each other out, leaving us with: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\log L(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)}{\\partial \\theta_1} = \\frac{-2\\sum{(x_i - \\theta_1)}(-1)}{2\\theta_2} \\stackrel{\\text{set}}{=} 0 \\] Now, multiplying through by \\(\\theta_2\\), and distributing the summation, we get: \\[ \\sum{x_i - n\\theta_1} = 0 \\] Now, solving for \\(\\theta_1\\), and putting on its hat, we have shown that the maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\theta_1\\) is: \\[ \\hat{\\theta}_1 = \\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{\\sum{x_i}}{n} = \\bar{x} \\] Now for \\(\\theta_2\\). Taking the partial derivative of the log likelihood with respect to \\(\\theta_2\\), and setting to 0, we get: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\log L(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)}{\\partial \\theta_2} = \\frac{-n}{2\\theta_2} + \\frac{\\sum{(x_i - \\theta_1)^2}}{2\\theta_2^2} \\stackrel{\\text{set}}{=} 0 \\] Multiplying through by \\(2\\theta_2^2\\), we get: \\[ -n\\theta_2 + \\sum{(x_i - \\theta_1)^2} = 0 \\] And, solving for \\(\\theta_2\\), and putting on its hat, we have shown that the maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\theta_2\\) is: \\[ \\hat{\\theta}_2 = \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum{(x_i - \\theta_1)^2}}{n} \\] (I’ll again leave it to you to verify, in each case, that the second partial derivative of the log likelihood is negative, and therefore that we did indeed find maxima.) In summary, we have shown that the maximum likelihood estimators of \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) for the normal model are: \\[ \\hat{\\mu} = \\left(\\sum{X_i}\\right)/n = \\bar{X} \\] and \\[ \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum{(X_i - \\bar{X})^2}}{n} \\] respectively. Note that the maximum likelihood estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\) for the normal model is not the sample variance \\(S^2\\). They are, in fact, competing estimators. So how do we know which estimator we should use for \\(\\sigma^2\\)? Well, one way is to choose the estimator that is “unbiased.” Let’s go learn about unbiased estimators. "],["neyman-pearson-lemma.html", "Chapter 2 Neyman-Pearson Lemma 2.1 The Neyman Pearson Lemma", " Chapter 2 Neyman-Pearson Lemma As we learned from our work in the previous lesson, whenever we perform a hypothesis test, we should make sure that the test we are conducting has sufficient power to detect a meaningful difference from the null hypothesis. That said, how can we be sure that the T-test for a mean \\(\\mu\\) is the “most powerful” test we could use? Is there instead a K-test or a V-test or you-name-the-letter-of-the-alphabet-test that would provide us with more power? A very important result, known as the Neyman-Pearson Lemma, will reassure us that each of the tests we learned in Section 7 is the most powerful test for testing statistical hypotheses about the parameter under the assumed probability distribution. Before we can present the lemma, however, we need to: Define some notation Learn the distinction between simple and composite hypotheses Define what it means to have a best critical region of size \\(\\alpha\\) Notation If \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) is a random sample of size \\(n\\) from a distribution with probability density (or mass) function \\(f(x; \\theta)\\), then the joint probability density (or mass) function of \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) is denoted by the likelihood function \\(L(\\theta)\\). That is, the joint p.d.f. or p.m.f. is: \\[ L(\\theta) =L(\\theta; x_1, x_2, ... , x_n) = f(x_1;\\theta) \\times f(x_2;\\theta) \\times ... \\times f(x_n;\\theta) \\] Note that for the sake of ease, we drop the reference to the sample \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) in using \\(L(\\theta)\\) as the notation for the likelihood function. We’ll want to keep in mind though that the likelihood \\(L(\\theta)\\) still depends on the sample data. Simple hypothesis If a random sample is taken from a distribution with parameter \\(\\theta\\), a hypothesis is said to be a simple hypothesis if the hypothesis uniquely specifies the distribution of the population from which the sample is taken. Any hypothesis that is not a simple hypothesis is called a composite hypothesis. Example 1 Suppose \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) is a random sample from an exponential distribution with parameter \\(\\theta\\). Is the hypothesis \\(H:\\theta =3\\) a simple or a composite hypothesis? Answer: The p.d.f. of an exponential random variable is: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\theta} e^ \\frac{-x}{\\theta} \\] for \\(x \\geq 0\\). Under the hypothesis \\(H:\\theta =3\\), the p.d.f. of an exponential random variable is: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{3} e^ \\frac{-x}{3} \\] for \\(x \\geq 0\\). Because we can uniquely specify the p.d.f. under the hypothesis \\(H:\\theta = 3\\), the hypothesis is a simple hypothesis. Example 2 Suppose \\(X_1, X_2, . . . ,X_n\\) is a random sample from an exponential distribution with parameter \\(\\theta\\). Is the hypothesis \\(H: \\theta &gt;2\\) a simple or a composite hypothesis? Answer: Again, the p.d.f. of an exponential random variable is: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\theta} e^ \\frac{-x}{\\theta} \\] for \\(x \\geq 0\\). Under the hypothesis \\(H: \\theta&gt;2\\), the p.d.f. of an exponential random variable could be: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{3} e^ \\frac{-x}{3} \\] for \\(x \\geq 0\\), or it could be: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{22} e^ \\frac{-x}{22} \\] for \\(x \\geq 0\\), or it could be any of an infinite number of possible exponential probability density functions. Because the p.d.f. is not uniquely specified under the hypothesis \\(H: \\theta&gt;2\\), the hypothesis is a composite hypothesis. Example 3 Suppose \\(X_1, X_2, . . . ,X_n\\) is a random sample from a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and unknown variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Is the hypothesis \\(H:\\mu = 12\\) a simple or a composite hypothesis? Answer: The p.d.f. of a normal random variable is: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left[{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\\right] \\] for \\(-\\infty &lt; x &lt; \\infty\\), \\(-\\infty &lt; \\mu &lt; \\infty\\), and \\(\\sigma &gt; 0\\). Under the hypothesis \\(H:\\mu = 12\\), the p.d.f. of a normal random variable is: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left[{-\\frac{(x-12)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\\right] \\] for \\(-\\infty &lt; x &lt; \\infty\\), and \\(\\sigma &gt; 0\\). In this case, the mean parameter \\(\\mu=12\\) is uniquely specified in the p.d.f., but the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) is not. Therefore, the hypothesis \\(H:\\mu = 12\\) is a composite hypothesis. Size of \\(\\alpha\\) Consider the test of the simple null hypothesis \\(H_0:\\theta = \\theta_0\\) against the simple alternative hypothesis \\(H_A: \\theta = \\theta_a\\). Let \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) be critical regions of size \\(\\alpha\\), that is, let: \\(\\alpha = P(C;\\theta_0)\\) and \\(\\alpha = P(D;\\theta_0)\\) Then, \\(C\\) is a best critical region of size \\(\\alpha\\) if the power of the test at \\(\\theta =\\theta_a\\) is the largest among all possible hypothesis tests. More formally, \\(C\\) is the best critical region of size \\(\\alpha\\) if, for every other critical region \\(D\\) of size \\(\\alpha\\), we have: \\[P(C;\\theta_0)&gt;P(D;\\theta_0)\\] That is, \\(C\\) is the best critical region of size \\(\\alpha\\) if the power of \\(C\\) is at least as great as the power of every other critical region \\(D\\) of size \\(\\alpha\\). We say that \\(C\\) is the most powerful size \\(\\alpha\\) test. Now that we have clearly defined what we mean for a critical region C to be “best,” we’re ready to turn to the Neyman Pearson Lemma to learn what form a hypothesis test must take in order for it to be the best, that is, to be the most powerful test. 2.1 The Neyman Pearson Lemma Suppose we have a random sample \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) from a probability distribution with parameter \\(\\theta\\). Then, if \\(C\\) is a critical region of size \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(k\\) is a constant such that: \\[ \\frac{L(\\theta_0)}{L(\\theta_1)} \\leq k \\quad \\text{inside the critical region } C \\] and: \\[ \\frac{L(\\theta_0)}{L(\\theta_1)} \\geq k \\quad \\text{outside the critical region } C \\] then \\(C\\) is the best, that is, most powerful, critical region for testing the simple null hypothesis \\(H_0:\\theta = \\theta_0\\) against the simple alternative hypothesis \\(H_A:\\theta = \\theta_a\\). Proof Well, okay, so perhaps the proof isn’t all that particularly enlightening, but perhaps if we take a look at a simple example, we’ll become more enlightened. Suppose \\(X\\) is a single observation (that’s one data point!) from a normal population with unknown mean \\(\\mu\\) and known standard deviation \\(\\sigma=1/3\\). Then, we can apply the Neyman-Pearson Lemma when testing the simple null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\mu = 3\\) against the simple alternative hypothesis \\(H_A:\\mu = 4\\). The lemma tells us that, in order to be the most powerful test, the ratio of the likelihoods: \\[ \\frac{L(\\mu_0)}{L(\\mu_\\alpha)}=\\frac{L(3)}{L(4)} \\] should be small for sample points \\(X\\) inside the critical region \\(C\\) (“less than or equal to some constant \\(k\\)”) and large for sample points \\(X\\) outside of the critical region (“greater than or equal to some constant \\(k\\)”). In this case, because we are dealing with just one observation \\(X\\), the ratio of the likelihoods equals the ratio of the normal probability curves: \\[ \\frac{L(3)}{L(4)}=\\frac{f(x; 3,1/9)}{f(x; 4,1/9)} \\] Then, the following drawing summarizes the situation: Alt text In short, it makes intuitive sense that we would want to reject \\(H_0:\\mu=3\\) in favor of \\(H_A:\\mu=4\\) if our observed \\(x\\) is large, that is, if our observed \\(x\\) falls in the critical region \\(C\\). Well, as the drawing illustrates, it is those large \\(X\\) values in \\(C\\) for which the ratio of the likelihoods is small; and, it is for the small \\(X\\) values not in \\(C\\) for which the ratio of the likelihoods is large. Just as the Neyman-Pearson Lemma suggests! Well, okay, that’s the intuition behind the Neyman-Pearson Lemma. Now, let’s take a look at a few examples of the lemma in action. Example 4 Suppose \\(X\\) is a single observation (again, one data point!) from a population with probability density function given by: \\[ f(x) = \\theta x^{\\theta-1} \\] for \\(0 &lt; x &lt; 1\\). Find the test with the best critical region, that is, find the most powerful test, with significance level \\(\\alpha =0.05,\\) for testing the simple null hypothesis \\(H_0:\\theta=3\\) against the simple alternative hypothesis \\(H_A:\\theta=2\\). Answer Because both the null and alternative hypotheses are simple hypotheses, we can apply the Neyman-Pearson Lemma in an attempt to find the most powerful test. The lemma tells us that the ratio of the likelihoods under the null and alternative must be less than some constant \\(k\\). Again, because we are dealing with just one observation \\(X\\), the ratio of the likelihoods equals the ratio of the probability density functions, giving us: \\[ \\frac{L(\\theta_0)}{L(\\theta_\\alpha)}=\\frac{3x^{3-1}}{2x^{2-1}}=\\frac{3}{2}x\\le k \\] That is, the lemma tells us that the form of the rejection region for the most powerful test is: \\[ \\frac{3}{2}x\\le k \\] or alternatively, since \\(\\frac{2}{3}k\\) is just a new constant \\(k^*\\), the rejection region for the most powerful test is of the form: \\[ x&lt;\\frac{3}{2}k= k^* \\] Now, it’s just a matter of finding \\(k^*\\), and our work is done. We want \\(\\alpha = P(\\text{Type I Error}) = P(\\text{rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true})\\) to equal \\(0.05\\). In order for that to happen, the following must hold: \\[ \\alpha=P(X&lt;k^* \\, when \\, \\theta=3)=\\int_{0}^{k^*}3x^2 \\, dx = 0.05 \\] Doing the integration, we get: \\[ \\left[x^3 \\right]_{x=0}^{x=k^*}=(k^*)^3 = 0.05 \\] And, solving for \\(k^*\\), we get: \\[ k^* = (0.05)^\\frac{1}{3} =0.368 \\] That is, the Neyman-Pearson Lemma tells us that the rejection region of the most powerful test for testing \\(H_0:\\theta = 3\\) against \\(H_A:\\theta = 2\\), under the assumed probability distribution, is: \\[ x &lt; 0.368 \\] That is, among all of the possible tests for testing \\(H_0:\\theta = 3\\) against \\(H_A:\\theta = 2\\), based on a single observation \\(X\\) and with a significance level of \\(0.05\\), this test has the largest possible value for the power under the alternative hypothesis, that is, when \\(\\theta = 2\\). Example 5 Suppose \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) is a random sample from a normal population with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance 16. Find the test with the best critical region, that is, find the most powerful test, with a sample size of \\(n = 16\\) and a significance level \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) to test the simple null hypothesis \\(H_0:\\mu = 10\\) against the simple alternative hypothesis \\(H_A:\\mu = 15\\). Answer Because the variance is specified, both the null and alternative hypotheses are simple hypotheses. Therefore, we can apply the Neyman-Pearson Lemma in an attempt to find the most powerful test. The lemma tells us that the ratio of the likelihoods under the null and alternative must be less than some constant \\(k\\): \\[ \\frac{L(10)}{L(15)} = \\frac{(32\\pi)^{-16/2}\\exp\\left[-(1/32)\\sum^{16}_{i=1}(x_i-10)^2\\right]}{(32\\pi)^{-16/2}\\exp\\left[-(1/32)\\sum^{16}_{i=1}(x_i-15)^2\\right]} \\le k \\] Simplifying, we get: \\[ exp \\left[ - \\left( \\dfrac{1}{32} \\right) \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{16}(x_i -10)^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{16}(x_i -15)^2 \\right) \\right] \\le k \\] And, simplifying yet more, we get: Alt text Now, taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the inequality, collecting like terms, and multiplying through by 32, we get: \\[-10\\Sigma x_i +2000 \\le 32ln(k)\\] And, moving the constant term on the left-side of the inequality to the right-side, and dividing through by −160, we get: \\[\\dfrac{1}{16}\\Sigma x_i \\ge -\\frac{1}{160}(32ln(k)-2000)\\] That is, the Neyman Pearson Lemma tells us that the rejection region for the most powerful test for testing \\(H_0:\\mu=10\\) against \\(H_A:\\mu=15\\), under the normal probability model, is of the form: \\[\\bar{x} \\ge k^*\\] where \\(k^*\\) is selected so that the size of the critical region is \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). That’s simple enough, as it just involves a normal probabilty calculation! Under the null hypothesis, the sample mean is normally distributed with mean 10 and standard deviation 4/4 = 1. Therefore, the critical value \\(k^*\\) is deemed to be 11.645: Alt text That is, the Neyman Pearson Lemma tells us that the rejection region for the most powerful test for testing \\(H_0:\\mu=10\\) against \\(H_A:\\mu=15\\), under the normal probability model, is: \\[\\bar{x}\\ge11.645\\] The power of such a test when \\(\\mu = 15\\) is: \\[P(\\bar{X} &gt; 11.645 \\text{ when } \\mu = 15) = P \\left( Z &gt; \\dfrac{11.645-15}{\\sqrt{16} / \\sqrt{16} } \\right) = P(Z &gt; -3.36) = 0.9996 \\] The power can’t get much better than that, and the Neyman Pearson Lemma tells us that we shouldn’t expect it to get better! That is, the Lemma tells us that there is no other test out there that will give us greater power for testing \\(H_0:\\mu=10\\) against \\(H_A:\\mu=15\\) "],["testing-and-estimation---large-vs.-small-samples.html", "Chapter 3 Testing and Estimation - Large vs. Small Samples 3.1 Central Limit Theorem (CLT) 3.2 Conceptual Explanation", " Chapter 3 Testing and Estimation - Large vs. Small Samples This lecture note explores the concepts of testing and estimation in the context of large and small samples. 3.1 Central Limit Theorem (CLT) The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes the behavior of sample means when drawing repeated samples from a population. It states that, regardless of the shape of the population distribution, the distribution of sample means will tend to be approximately normal as the sample size increases. 3.2 Conceptual Explanation The CLT is based on three key principles: Sampling Distribution: When we draw multiple samples from a population and calculate the mean of each sample, we create a sampling distribution of the sample means. Approximate Normality: The distribution of sample means will be approximately normal if the sample size is sufficiently large, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. This is particularly true for sample sizes greater than 30. Mean and Standard Deviation: The mean of the sample means will be approximately equal to the population mean, and the standard deviation of the sample means (standard error) will decrease as the sample size increases. Example 1 Suppose we want to understand the distribution of the mean height of students in the campus of Gadau. We’ll collect the heights of 10000 students as our population data. # Simulate student heights in Gadau campus set.seed(123) student_heights &lt;- rnorm(1000, mean = 170, sd = 10) # Display summary statistics of student heights summary(student_heights) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 141.9 163.7 170.1 170.2 176.6 202.4 # Number of samples num_samples &lt;- 1000 # Sample size sample_size &lt;- 30 # Initialize a vector to store sample means sample_means &lt;- numeric(num_samples) # Take random samples and calculate means for (i in 1:num_samples) { sample &lt;- sample(student_heights, sample_size) sample_means[i] &lt;- mean(sample) } # Plot the distribution of sample means hist(sample_means, breaks = 30, main = &quot;Distribution of Sample Means&quot;, xlab = &quot;Sample Mean Height (cm)&quot;, col = &quot;lightblue&quot;, border = &quot;white&quot;) In the histogram above, we can observe that as the number of samples increases, the distribution of sample means becomes more symmetric and bell-shaped, resembling a normal distribution. This is consistent with the Central Limit Theorem. Example 2: Rolling a Fair Die Suppose we want to understand the distribution of the mean of rolling a fair six-sided die. We will simulate rolling the die 1000 times and calculate the mean for each set of rolls. # Set seed for reproducibility set.seed(123) # Simulate rolling a fair six-sided die 1000 times num_rolls &lt;- 1000 die_rolls &lt;- sample(1:6, num_rolls, replace = TRUE) # Calculate the mean of each set of rolls sample_means &lt;- numeric(num_rolls) for (i in 1:num_rolls) { sample_means[i] &lt;- mean(sample(die_rolls, i)) } # Plot the distribution of sample means hist(sample_means, breaks = 30, main = &quot;Distribution of Sample Means&quot;, xlab = &quot;Sample Mean&quot;, col = &quot;lightblue&quot;, border = &quot;white&quot;) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
